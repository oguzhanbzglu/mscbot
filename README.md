### Master Thesis Project - ROS2


This repository showcases the development of a custom autonomous robot designed for my Master's Thesis in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The project explores the integration of ROS 2 for robot control and navigation.

## Project Highlights

- **Kinematic Equations:** The repository includes detailed kinematic equations that describe the motion of the robot.

- **Controller Design:** Various types of controllers have been implemented and tested to manage the robot's behavior.

- **System Demonstrations:** The results of the system's performance are demonstrated through simulations and real-world tests.

## Future Applications - Working on...soon..!

### In future work, the project will involve:

- **Advanced Controllers:** Application of different controllers to enhance the robot's capabilities.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Integration of obstacle detection mechanisms to improve navigation.
- **Real-Time Challenges:** Addressing and overcoming real-time challenges to ensure robust and reliable performance.
